1. What is the CPU model name?
    Answer:
    Intel(R) Xeon(R) Silver 4210 CPU @ 2.20GHz

    How I got it:
    Running the "cat /proc/cpuinfo" command prints the cpuinfo file to the console. Inside this file their is an entry for CPU model name.

2. What version of the Linux Kernel is being used?
    Answer:
    Linux version 2.6.32-754.24.3.el6.i686

    How I got it:
    Running the "cat /proc/version" command prints kernel information on the host system. The first entry is the exact kernel version.

3. How long (in days, hours, and minutes) has it been since the system was last booted?
    Answer: 
    276 days, 23 hours, and 32 minutes (ran at 1:37pm on 9/26)

    How I got it:
    Running the "cat /proc/uptime" will print the number of seconds since system boot in the first number. Some math can be done on this
    value to convert it to days, hours, and minutes.

4. How much of the total CPU time has been spent executing in user mode? System mode? Idle?
    Answer: 
    331,711.56 seconds in User Mode, 154,048.83 seconds in System Mode, 21,474,836.48 seconds Idle (ran at 1:41pm on 9/26)

    NOTE: Original value was divided by the system variable _SC_CLK_TCK to convert to seconds

    How I got it:
    Running the "cat /proc/stat" command prints basic information about the host system. Inside this file, in the CPU line is aggregated
    time values for all CPUs. This is organized into columns with each value defining the time spent in that mode listed as follows:
    (normal process in user mode, niced processes in user mode, system proccesses in kernel mode, idle time). Each value is reported in Jiffies
    or USER_HZ typically 1/100th of a second in most Linux enviroments (we can convert this value to seconds by dividing it by the system variable
    _SC_CLK_TCK). Note, the amount of time in each mode could exceed uptime due to each CPU core having its own unique values.

5. How much memory is configured into it?
    Answer: 
    8180520 kB

    How I got it:
    Running the "cat /proc/meminfo" command prints memory information for the host system to the console. The first line in this file is
    memTotal which defines the total memory installed in the system in kilobytes.

6. How much memory is currently available in it?
    Answer: 
    4372112 kB (ran at 1:52pm on 9/26)

    How I got it:
    Running the "cat /proc/meminfo" command prints memory information for the host system to the console. The second line in this file is
    memFree which the defines the total amount of memory free at read time listed in kilobytes.

7. How many disk read/write requests have been made?
    Answer: 
    35,715,517 reads completed and 95,835,278 writes completed (ran at 1:54pm on 9/26)

    How I got it:
    Running the "cat /proc/diskstats" command prints disk information for the host system to the console. The total number of reads can be found
    by adding up the value in the 4th column for each device listed, the total number of writes can be found by adding up the value in the 8th column
    for each device listed. Note, HDD devices are listed as sd devices in Linux. In this file, each partition for a given drive is listed, the top
    line gives aggregated values across all partitions.

8. How many context switches has the kernel performed?
    Answer: 5,594,091,199 (ran at 1:58pm on 9/26)

    How I got it:
    Running the "cat /proc/stat" command prints basic device info for the host system to the console. The line labeled "ctxt" lists the number of
    context switches performed on all CPUs.

9. How many processes have been created since the system was booted?
    Answer: 51,304,488 (ran at 1:58pm on 9/26)

    How I got it:
    Running the "cat /proc/stat" command prints basic device info for the host system to the console. The line labeled "processes" lists the 
    number of processes/threads created.
